# Alternative Redox W case with Tenting Stilts

This is a case modification for [Redox W](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard)  

## Source Materials

Original case design is the one in [redox-w repository](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard)

Tenting kit modification was originally created by Lenbok in his [repository under redox-rev0-mod folder](https://github.com/Lenbok/scad-redox-case.git) for a redox handwired keyboard.

Fork of that mod (barely) suitable for redox-w can be found under scad

Just for the sake of completeness, unmodified redox-w top STL's will also be hosted here.


## Important
I have very questionable 3D skills at best. YMMV with this design
